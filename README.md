# Data Science Job Clustering and Classification

This project focuses on clustering and classification tasks to analyze job postings in the data science field. It includes clustering data to group similar job postings and classification tasks to predict job types based on features such as job description, skills, and qualifications.

The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to achieve clustering and classification objectives, demonstrating real-world applications of data science techniques.

```

🚀 **Running the Project:**

You can open the notebooks in Jupyter to run the project steps:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

- To perform **clustering analysis**, open:
  - `CLUSTERING_MODEL/[Clustering]_Submission_Akhir_BMLP_Jihan_Kusumawardhani.ipynb`

- To perform **classification analysis**, open:
  - `CLASSIFICATION_MODEL/[Klasifikasi]_Submission_Akhir_BMLP_Jihan_Kusumawardhani.ipynb`

📊 **Technologies Used:**

- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy 📊
- Scikit-learn 🤖
- Jupyter Notebook 📓

🎯 **Project Goals:**

- Group data science job postings into clusters based on similar features using clustering algorithms like **K-means** and **Hierarchical Clustering**.
- Use machine learning classification techniques to predict job types based on features like skills, years of experience, and job description.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics, such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
